______________________________________________________
## Overview
This repository contains the code for our solution to the Diabetic Retinopathy GDSC Solution Challenge 2024. Our solution involves a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model integrated within a system for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy.

## Dataset Source
We obtained the dataset used in this project from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sovitrath/diabetic-retinopathy-224x224-gaussian-filtered)

 The dataset consists of retinal images annotated for diabetic retinopathy severity levels. It includes images from various sources and is labeled by expert ophthalmologists for training and evaluation of machine learning models for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.
